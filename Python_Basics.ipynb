        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "Ans: - Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "Popularity reasons:\n",
        "•\tEasy to learn and use\n",
        "•\tExtensive libraries and frameworks\n",
        "•\tStrong community support\n",
        "•\tVersatile applications (web, data science, AI, automation)\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "Ans: - An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line. It translates high-level Python code into machine-readable instructions during runtime, allowing for immediate feedback and debugging.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "Ans: - Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning and are part of the language syntax. Examples include if, else, while, for, def, class, True, False, etc. These cannot be used as identifiers like variable names.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "Ans: - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for specific functions and control structures in Python. Using them as variable names would result in a syntax error.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "Ans: - Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created.\n",
        "•\tMutable objects can be modified (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
        "•\tImmutable objects cannot be changed (e.g., strings, tuples).\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "Ans: - Lists are designed to store dynamic data, allowing modifications like adding or removing elements. Tuples, on the other hand, are meant to store fixed data, ensuring consistency and allowing them to be used as keys in dictionaries due to their immutability.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "•\tAns: - == checks if two variables have the same value.\n",
        "•\tis checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "Ans: - Logical operators are used to combine boolean expressions:\n",
        "•\tand: Returns True if both operands are True.\n",
        "•\tor: Returns True if at least one operand is True.\n",
        "•\tnot: Returns the opposite of the operand’s boolean value.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "Ans: - Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. It can be done manually using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "Ans: -\n",
        "•\tImplicit casting is done automatically by Python when needed.\n",
        "•\tExplicit casting is done manually by the programmer using casting functions.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "Ans: - Conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They control the flow of execution using if, elif, and else statements.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "Ans: - The elif (else if) statement allows checking multiple conditions after an initial if. If the if condition is False, Python checks the elif condition(s) before moving to else.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "Ans: -\n",
        "•\tfor loop: Used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence.\n",
        "•\twhile loop: Used when the loop should continue until a condition becomes False.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "Ans: - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
        "Example: Continuously prompting a user for input until they enter a specific value like \"exit\".\n",
